# shinypipe
R Package for shiny modules to be used as reusable components in building data processing pipelines

I created these because I was finding them useful for my own projects. Some examples of the reusable modules in this package.

## Demos

### Develop/Debug from within the shiny app

- This particularly helps me build the app in small chunks without having to render the whole app for every change.

### Plot examples
- Some common plot functionality like zoom and select using just shiny and ggplot.

- Another example with zoom functionality disabled

### Formula editor
- Useful in any regression/classification setting
